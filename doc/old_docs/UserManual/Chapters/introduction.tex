\chapter{Introduction} 

This manual shows you how to run HRC simulation scenarios, where human and robot can interact and collaborate with each other in the task of grasping an object from a conveyor belt. It enables you to visualize and investigate how robot observes the behaviours of human and makes his decision. It also helps you to understand how the collaboration between human and robot works. The simulation scenarios are created on morse platform. For the communication between different components, we use webSocket and ROS service.\\

The behaviours of human are based on a MDP(Markow Decision Process) model. By using MDP, we can simulate different behaviours for humans. We provide different MDP model files that users can choose from. In the robot side, how robot understands the behavious of human and makes correct response are a tough task. We use a POMDP(Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) model to simulate the decision-making procedure for robot.\\

This manual works as follows. First of all we will introduce our tool with a getting started guide, which includes how to compile the codes and how to successfully run a morse example scenario. Afterwards the theoritical background are to be explained. The manual closes with a FAQ chapter.

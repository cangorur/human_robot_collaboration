\chapter{Most Frequently Asked Questions}

\section{Are different computer systems(Window, MacOS), different Morse version or different ROS version also supported?}
For now we haven't tested our code in any other system environments(system, morse, ROS), so there maybe some unexpected errors or bugs when running our codes in a different environment.

\section{Replacing the morse source codes with the provided codes seems a bit unconvenient, are there any different ways?}
Yes, it's not so convenient to replace the morse sourse codes with our codes. Howerer, our codes only extend the functionalities of morse and dont' conflict with original morsesource codes. This makes sure that you can our extended codes in your other project. If you are still not sure, we would recommend you to make a back-up for all the modified codes first.

\section{Where are the MDP and POMDP model files? How can I change them?}
The model files are under path: /code/despot\_MDP/examples/pomdpx\_models/data/ and /code/despot\_POMDP/examples/pomdpx\_models/data/. For MDP, we provide five different scenario files; for POMDP we provide one model file. You can change the model files easily by changing the path in the two files despot\_MDP\_shell.sh and despot\_shell.sh, which are located under path: /code/ros\-ws/src/ros\_hrc/.

## Some tips for working with rosbags 

# replaying depth bags with openni2 
roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch load_driver:=false depth_registration:=true
rosbag play --clock dataset_upd.bag

# filtering rosbags and export only selected topics 
rosbag filter my.bag only-tf.bag "topic in ['/camera/depth_registered/camera_info' , '/camera/depth_registered/image_raw' , '/camera/rgb/camera_info' , '/camera/rgb/image_raw' ]"

# running the action_recognition part 
roslaunch object_tracking tracking.launch

# topics relevant for POMDP -> tray_update and action_recognized 
/experiment_monitoring/robot_action_taken_pub   |   published by /robot_motion_agent      | published after DESPOT informed
/observation_agent/observation_update		|   published by /observation_agent_IE    | published when sending obs to DESPOT


# topics published by action recognition
/object_tracking/publish_tray_update		| The observation_agent must be running 
/camera_agent/motion_features 			| motion feature only no classes
/action_recognition/publish_action_recognized   | classes published byHMMGMM(5.py) | published when service is issued to obs_agent

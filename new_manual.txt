This note involves steps to succesfully install the current HRC simulation (also referring to the other notes). Also includes some improvements to:

STEPS to install:

navigate to code/ros_ws/
>catkin_make

navigate to code/despot_MDP
>mkdir build
>cd build
>cmake ..
>make

navigate to code/despot_POMDP
>mkdir build
>cd build
>cmake ..
>make

Warning: Before we start overwriting some of the morse source files, you may want to create their copies!

navigate to code/hrc_morse/src
We will replace human.py class with our version:
>sudo cp human.py /opt/lib/python3/dist-packages/morse/robots/
We will replace pr2.py class with our version:
>sudo cp pr2.py /opt/lib/python3/dist-packages/morse/robots/
We will replace main.py of blender with our version (a bug fix for overlayed objects):
>sudo cp main.py /opt/lib/python3/dist-packages/morse/blender/
Add the conveyor belt as a robot to open ros service interfaces to be able to control its operation
>sudo cp conveyor.py /opt/lib/python3/dist-packages/morse/builder/robots/
>sudo cp conveyor_srv.py /opt/lib/python3/dist-packages/morse/robots/

navigate to code/hrc_morse/data
We will replace human.blend with our updated design:
>sudo cp human.blend /opt/share/morse/data/robots/
We will replace pr2.blend with our updated design
>sudo cp pr2.blend /opt/share/morse/data/robots/
Add the conveyor belt blend drawing to the morse project
>sudo cp band.blend /opt/share/morse/data/robots/

make surethat your builder script has this line to import conveyor belt properly:
>from morse.builder.robots.conveyor import *

To add more conveyor belts tip to tip (longer band):
>conveyor1 = Conveyor()
>conveyor1.translate(x, y, z)
>conveyor2 = Conveyor()
>conveyor2.translate(x, y-1.8, z)

To add L shaped conveyor belts:
>conveyor1 = Conveyor()
>conveyor1.translate(x, y, z)
>conveyor2 = Conveyor()
>conveyor2.translate(x + 1.4, y - 0.6, z)
>conveyor2.rotate(z = pi/2) # if math is not imported, then z = 1.57


navigate to code/
>morse import hrc_morse # --> this is to import the folder as a morse project

STEPS to run:
> source ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
> roscore
> morse run hrc_morse hrc_scenario.py
> roslaunch hrc_ros hrc.launch

userStudies_final_v1: with all 18 policies (including the jsut remind models) 
userStudies_final_v2: without just remind models = 12 policies --> these are both extracted from observation and performance models. Also, observation model is averaged for all the policies in the end leaving one estimation model for all policies.
userStudies_final_v2_2: Same as version2, but a little manual tweaking on the performance model: some mistaching between estimation results and the policy selection is fixed.
userStudies_final_v3: without just remind models = 12 policies --> these are both extracted from observation and performance models. Observation model is kept original = one estimation model per policy.

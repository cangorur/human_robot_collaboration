Part-0: Dilge, 6 tasks in total, with old model.
Part-1: Doruk, 8 tasks in total, with v2_2 model. Nice adaptation, though the policy didnt change much
Part-3: not known
Part-4: not known
Part-5: Tuguldur, 8 tasks in total, with v2_2 model. Couldnt understand the tasks, lots of HW issues. Didnt like the robots although it helped him a lot with the high success rates.
Part-6: Martin, 8 tasks in total with v2_2 model. Martin got expertise and learnt the rules. Robot adapted well by first interfering a lot, then leaving it not to touch at all. The success rate and the scores got up to 100% towards the end.
Part-7: Mathias. Couldnt follow the tasks at all. But always stubbornly taking the cubes. A lot of fluctuations between the tasks (in terms of what he wants, success rates etc.) Eventually didnt like the robot's adaptation.
Part-8: Tobias. Very nice collaboration. Robot estimated the type very well after the 4th task and fixated on a policy which kept the success rate and the collaboraiton smooth. Tobi was happy with it.
Part-9: Nils. Very nice collaboration also. He built expertise homogenously in time. The robot picked the right policy towards the end (to wait and observe).

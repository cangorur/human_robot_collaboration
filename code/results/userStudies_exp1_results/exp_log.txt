---- Turn-2,3,4,5 for proactive, Turn-7.8.9 for reactive ----
Exp-1: Yingwoo, 4 Proactive tasks, skipped reactive
Exp-2: Hugo, 4 proactive tasks, skipped reactive
---- Turn-2,3,4 for proactive, Turn-6,7,8 for reactive ----
Exp-3: Anna, 4 proactive tasks (turn-6 also filled for this), skipped reactive
Exp-4: Nese, both are finalized. Didnt understand what reactive means. She wanted to them all
Exp-5: Ana, both are finalized. Understood everything well. She collaborated nicely
Exp-6: Sara, both are finalized. Understood everything expect what is reactive ! She didnt want the robot to take at all but all do it by herself
Exp-7: Eduardo, both are finalized. Didnt understand what reactive means. He thought the second one is smarter due to the timing. Couldnt catch the pattern.
Exp-8: Francesca, both are finalized. She struggled with the tasks. Poor success rates. Increased with the robot. She liked the proactive one and understood what is reactive/repetitive. The video for the turn-4 is good: includes robot leaving the decision to her, she left it to robot. Robot encouraged by not moving and she did it right, cause she was on a good track with the last two and robot respected that.
Exp-9: Kamila, both are finalized. first reactive then proactive. Her success rate increased a lot with proactive. She liked it more. Had to warn a lot (both of the robots). She figured out how to work with them towards the end (like the fact that she could leave the cubes to the robot to do so). First, she was trying only for herself, eventhough she wouldnt remember. 
Exp-10: Fabrizio, both are finalized. Generally let the robot do everything. He liked the reactive one at the beginning, until he realized that he should do it more himself due to the low scores. THen, started warning. He realized the second robot was more friendly and understanding. He also has a moment of waiting for each other to grasp :).

---- Turn-2,3,4,5 for proactive, Turn-7.8.9 for reactive ----
Exp-1: Yingwoo, 4 Proactive tasks, skipped reactive
Exp-2: Hugo, 4 proactive tasks, skipped reactive

---- Turn-2,3,4 for proactive, Turn-6,7,8 for reactive ----
Exp-3: Anna, 4 proactive tasks (turn-6 also filled for this), skipped reactive

Exp-4: Nese, both are finalized. Didnt understand what reactive means. She wanted to them all. First proactive (turn-2,3,4), then reactive (turn-6-7-8)!

Exp-5: Ana, both are finalized. Understood everything well. She collaborated nicely. First proactive (turn-2,3,4), then reactive (turn-6-7-8)!

Exp-6: Sara, both are finalized. Understood everything expect what is reactive ! She didnt want the robot to take at all but all do it by herself. First proactive (turn-2,3,4), then reactive (turn-6-7-8)!

Exp-7: Eduardo, both are finalized. Didnt understand what reactive means. He thought the second one is smarter due to the timing. Couldnt catch the pattern. First proactive (turn-2,3,4), then reactive (turn-6-7-8)!

Exp-8: Francesca, both are finalized. She struggled with the tasks. Poor success rates. Increased with the robot. She liked the proactive one and understood what is reactive/repetitive. The video for the turn-4 is good: includes robot leaving the decision to her, she left it to robot. Robot encouraged by not moving and she did it right, cause she was on a good track with the last two and robot respected that. First reactive (turn-6-7-8), then proactive (turn-2,3,4)!

Exp-9: Kamila, both are finalized. first reactive then proactive. Her success rate increased a lot with proactive. She liked it more. Had to warn a lot (both of the robots). She figured out how to work with them towards the end (like the fact that she could leave the cubes to the robot to do so). First, she was trying only for herself, eventhough she wouldnt remember. First reactive (turn-6-7-8), then proactive (turn-2,3,4)!

Exp-10: Fabrizio, both are finalized. Generally let the robot do everything. He liked the reactive one at the beginning, until he realized that he should do it more himself due to the low scores. THen, started warning. He realized the second robot was more friendly and understanding. He also has a moment of waiting for each other to grasp :). First reactive (turn-6-7-8), then proactive (turn-2,3,4)!

Exp-11: Jakoppo, both are finalized. Generally warned the robot a lot. First reactive (turn-6-7-8), then proactive (turn-2,3,4)!

Exp-12: Yusuf, both are finalized. Understood the robots very well. Generally rememberred the rules. First reactive (turn-6-7-8), then proactive (turn-2,3,4)!

Exp-13: Arda, both are finalized. Might be outlier. Didnt understand the robot well. Warned always eventhough didnt want to take. Encouraged by the robot (turn-7 or turn-8?). First reactive (turn-6,7,8), then proactive (turn-2,3,4).

Exp-14: Burak Can, both are finalized. Skipped turn-5 (2nd alone task). Understood the robots really well. What is an adaptation and how it works and etc. First proactive (turn-2,3,4), then reactive (turn-6,7,8)

Exp-15: Andrea, both are finalized. Very good at memorizing all. put really high scores.First proactive (turn-2,3,4), then reactive (turn-6,7,8)

Exp-16: Baris, both are finalized. Experience increased. Good memory. First reactive (turn-6,7,8), then proactive (turn-2,3,4).

Exp-17: GÃ¶ksu,  both are finalized. Experience and the success rate dropped due to the reactive robot's interferences. First proactive (turn-2,3,4), then reactive (turn-6,7,8)

---- Result analysis ----

Subjective (survey) results are under analysis_subjective. Each question is examined on its own
Objective measures are under each recorded bag folders. To extract the data:
* First bag_to_csv on each bag data. 
* Then, renumber the tasks: python rename_tasks.py <folder name> <ID as integer>
* Add each raw_renumbered.csv from each turn to one raw_data.csv file.
* Run update_sensor_data.py save_all and update_robot_data.py save_all functions are used to construct the analysis.
* You only need robot_final_results.csv, human_observables.csv
